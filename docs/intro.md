# Dear NEARbie

## A Warm Welcome

We are excited to see you on our Welcome NEAR University page.
Here we offer self-study materials and tutorials to various groups of individuals who wish to learn more about how to engage with the NEAR blockchain.

If you are a NEARbie who is:

Otherwise, we would be most glad to welcome you on our homepage, at [NEAR University](https://www.near.university), where you can find more information on how to learn, earn and connect with the NEAR community.
